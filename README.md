# SQL

My sql project made using sql workbench where the action output was taken out and copy pasted to give everyone an idea of what sort of coding was used.
I have also attached screenshots of some common queries such as how to find a certain table and to only return data of students who was taking a certain course. 
The google doc contains my schema I used in SQL and the ER diagram i used to make the schema.
